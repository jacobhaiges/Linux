# Prerequisites 

# VirtualBox

This tutorial uses [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to provision the virtual machines.

# Vagrant

This tutorial uses [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), which builds and maintains virtual environments, to quickly deploy virtual machines so you can experiment without fear of messing anything up.

# SSH Client

You will need an SSH client to connect to the VM's. Windows doesn't come with one by default as Mac/Linux does, so you will need to install one. I recommend installing [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) as it comes with an SSH client.
